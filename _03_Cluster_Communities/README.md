# Clustering of gene communities based on Jaccard index

This folder contains the Python codes allowing to perform a clustering of gene communities based on their similarity using Jaccard index.

The Jaccard index is the ratio of the common genes between two communities over the union of their genes.

## Files

* ```cluster_communities.py```: Python script containing functions to compute pairwise Jaccard indices between communities and perform the clustering of communities.

* ```analyse_genes_in_clusters.py```: Python script containing functions to analyse the genes represented inside clusters of communities.

## Usage

    python cluster_communities.py -p /path/where/communities/folders/are/stored

    python analyse_genes_in_clusters.py -p /path/where/communities/folders/are/stored

## Output

* ```output_figures```: folder containing the generated figures which are a clustermap of disease-associated communities based on Jaccard index and the corresponding dendrogram of diseases, generated by the ```cluster_communities.py``` script.

* ```output_tables```: folder containing files describing the genes represented in each cluster of communities, generated by the script ```analyse_genes_in_clusters.py```. This script also generates a file ```cluster_100.tsv``` which recapitulates the diseases in each cluster.

The script ```cluster_communities.py``` also generates a file ```cluster_output_100_0.7.tsv``` which recapitulates which communities are gathered in each cluster. This file is also copied in the ```_00_data``` folder for it to be used for downstream analysis.
