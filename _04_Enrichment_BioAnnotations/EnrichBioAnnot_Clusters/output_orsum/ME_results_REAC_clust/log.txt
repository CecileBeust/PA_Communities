7 terms are smaller than minTermSize=10, they are removed.

Initial term number (recurring terms in different lists are not merged yet, each one is counted): 906

Same terms in multiple lists are unified
Representing term number: 658

Superterms represent their less significant (worse ranked) subterms. This includes equal terms, i.e. the terms that annotate exactly the same set of genes.
Representing term number: 94
