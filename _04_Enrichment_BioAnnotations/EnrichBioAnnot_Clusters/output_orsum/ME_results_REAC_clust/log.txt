Initial term number (recurring terms in different lists are not merged yet, each one is counted): 1432

Same terms in multiple lists are unified
Representing term number: 870

Superterms represent their less significant (worse ranked) subterms. This includes equal terms, i.e. the terms that annotate exactly the same set of genes.
Representing term number: 123
