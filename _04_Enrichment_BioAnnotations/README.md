# Enrichment of gene communities, or clusters of communities using biological annotations 

This folder contains codes to perform an enrichment of gene communities (or clusters of communities) using biological annotations from the Gene Ontology (GO Biological Processes and GO Cellular Components) and Reactome pathways terms. It is possible to do the same analysis using other biological annotations.

The enrichement analysis are performed using g:Profiler, and the enrichement results are filtered using orsum.

## Folders and files

The folder ```EnrichBioAnnot_Clusters``` contains the codes to perform the enrichment analysis of clusters of communities. It ocntains the following scripts:

* ```enrichment_clusters.py```: Python script containing functions to perform enrichment analysis of clusters of communities. 
* ```orsum_enrichment_clusters.py```: Python script containing functions to filter the enrichment results of clusters using orsum.

The folder ```EnrichBioAnnot_Communities``` contains the codes to perform the enrichment analysis of the communities. It contains the following scripts:

* ```enrichment_communities.py```: Python script containing functions to perform enrichment analysis of individual communities
* ```orsum_enrichment_communities.py```: Python script containing functions to filter the enrichment results of communities using orsum.

## Usage

    python enrichment_clusters.py -p /path/where/communities/folders/are/stored

    python enrichment_communities.py -p /path/where/communities/folders/are/stored

After having modified the script with your version of orsum (line 53), run:

    python orsum_enrichment_clusters.py

    python orsum_enrichment_communities.py


## Output

For both enrichments at the level of clusters or communities, the enrichment results will be generated in the folders ```EnrichBioAnnot_Clusters/output_tables``` and ```EnrichBioAnnot_Communities/output_tables```. The files generated by orsum and the results of the enrihcment filtering, including the corresponding heatmaps, are generated inthe ```EnrichBioAnnot_Clusters/output_orsum``` and ```EnrichBioAnnot_Communities/output_orsum``` folders.
