This is a collection of gmt files with the data underlying the g:GOSt enrichment service.
gmt files are plain text tab-separated files that can be opened in text editors (e.g., notepad) or spreadsheet editors (e.g., Excel).

TRANSFAC (TF) and KEGG are omitted from this archive due to licensing issues.

the gmt files for GO:BP (hsapiens.GO:BP.name.gmt) and REACTOME (hsapiens.REAC.name.gmt
